# C-Data-Types-and-Memory-Addresses
A beginner C program exploring basic data types, format specifiers, and memory addresses.

## Technical Skills Practiced
Through this project, the following concepts were implemented:
* **Variable Declaration:** Usage of `char`, `int`, `float`, and `long long`.
* **Format Specifiers:** Correct implementation of `%c`, `%d`, `%f`, and `%lld` to display data.
* **Memory Addressing:** Using the `&` (Address-of) operator to locate variables.
* **Pointer Visualization:** Using the `%p` specifier for standard memory address formatting.

## Code Logic
The program initializes several types of variables and prints:
1. The literal value stored in the variable.
2. The exact memory location (pointer) where the computer stores that specific piece of data.

## How to Compile and Run
To test this code on your local environment:

1.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    gcc main.c -o memory_test
    ```
2.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    ./memory_test
    ```
